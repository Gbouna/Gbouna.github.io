I am a researcher specialising in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), with expertise  in computer vision for ambient assisted living technologies. I am self-motivated, collaborative, and results-driven. My goal is to enhance the quality of life for the elderly by developing ambient assisted living technologies that support their independent living while addressing their needs and concerns.

# Research Focus

My research explores the intersection of HCI and AI, leveraging AI and HCI principles to design ambient assisted living technologies that prioritise user needs, concerns. My key research areas include:
* Privacy-aware human activity recognition.
* Fostering user trust in monitoring technologies.
* Acceptance of vision-based monitoring technologies in home environments.
* Thermally comfortable and energy-efficient home environment.
