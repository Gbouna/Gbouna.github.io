<div class="page__content">

I am a dedicated researcher specialising in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), with expertise in computer vision for ambient assisted living technologies. I am self-motivated, collaborative, and results-driven, with strong communication and analytical skills. My goal is to enhance the quality of life for the elderly by developing ambient assisted living technologies that support their independent living while addressing their needs and concerns.

My research explores the intersection of HCI and AI, leveraging computer vision and responsible AI principles to design ambient assisted living technologies that prioritise user needs, concerns, and ethical considerations. My key research areas include:

* **Privacy-aware human activity recognition**  
  Developing non-intrusive monitoring systems that preserve user privacy.

* **Fostering user trust in monitoring technologies**  
  Investigating human factors and interface designs.

* **Acceptance of vision-based monitoring technologies**  
  Studying adoption barriers in home environments.

* **Thermally comfortable environments**  
  Creating smart systems for comfort and energy efficiency.
