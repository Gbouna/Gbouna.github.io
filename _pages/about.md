I conduct research on intelligent home environments that integrate computer vision, embedded AI, and humanâ€“computer interaction to support independent living and ageing in place. My work spans human activity recognition, user acceptance of ambient assisted living technologies, and occupant-centred control for energy-efficient home management. Across these directions, I focus on developing adaptive, privacy-preserving, and sustainable systems that promote user trust and comfort. Visit the Research page for more details about my research focus.
