I am a researcher specialising in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), with expertise in designing human-centred Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) technologies. I am self-motivated, collaborative, and results-driven, with strong communication and analytical skills. My goal is to advance human-centred computing by developing impactful solutions that address societal challenges and promote user acceptance.

My research focuses on developing human-centred Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) technologies that address the perspectives and concerns of end users to enhance acceptance and adoption. My research interest includes the following:
- Privacy-centric human activity recognition 
- Human behaviour analysis
- User-friendly interface design 
- User-centred privacy control design
- Thermally comfortable and energy-efficient environments
