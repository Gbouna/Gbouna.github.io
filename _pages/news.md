## Featured Cover Paper: Enhancing Human-Robot Collaboration in Healthcare 4.0.

Our paper was featured on the cover page, highlighting our contribution to safe and intuitive human-robot collaboration in Healthcare 4.0. We proposed a modular proximity sensing solution based on self-capacitive technology, enabling collaborative robots to detect approach and contact. Operating in both interaction and safety modes, the system supports gesture-based control and obstacle avoidance, enhancing telehealthcare delivery in human-centred environments.
