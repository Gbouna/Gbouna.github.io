    <h2>Best Paper Award: Privacy-Preserving Activity Recognition for Ambient Assisted Living</h2>
    <p>
      Our paper received the <b>Best Paper Award</b> for its innovative approach to 
      preserving user privacy in computer vision-based activity monitoring. 
      We introduced TD-GDSCN, which performs accurate activity recognition locally, 
      eliminating the need to stream sensitive data to the cloud.

    <h2>Best Paper Award: IoT-Based Monitoring System for Smart Building Energy and Environmental Management</h2>
    <p>
      Our paper received the <b>Best Paper Award</b> for presenting an integrated, 
      non-invasive IoT-based monitoring system designed to improve energy efficiency 
      and indoor environmental quality (IEQ) in buildings. 
      The system combines hardware and software components to collect, process, 
      and visualise high-resolution energy and IEQ data in real time.

    <h2>Featured Cover Paper: Enhancing Human-Robot Collaboration in Healthcare 4.0</h2>
    <p>
      Our paper was <b>featured on the cover page</b>, highlighting our contribution to 
      safe and intuitive human-robot collaboration in Healthcare 4.0. 
      We proposed a modular proximity sensing solution based on self-capacitive technology, 
      enabling collaborative robots to detect approach and contact. 
      Operating in both interaction and safety modes, the system supports gesture-based control 
      and obstacle avoidance, enhancing telehealthcare delivery in human-centred environments.
