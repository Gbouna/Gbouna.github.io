## Best Paper Award: Privacy-Preserving Activity Recognition for Ambient Assisted Living

Our paper received the Best Paper Award for its innovative approach to preserving user privacy in computer vision-based activity monitoring for older adults. We introduced a method that performs accurate activity recognition locally, eliminating the need to stream sensitive data to the cloud. The proposed TD-GDSCN model, combined with a novel data augmentation technique, addresses real-time performance and environmental variability. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing methods. Details of the paper can be found below:

## Best Paper Award: IoT-Based Monitoring System for Smart Building Energy and Environmental Management

Our paper received the Best Paper Award for presenting an integrated, non-invasive IoT-based monitoring system designed to improve energy efficiency and indoor environmental quality (IEQ) in buildings. The system combines hardware and software components to collect, process, and visualise high-resolution energy and IEQ data in real time. By enabling intelligent and user-friendly energy management, the solution aims to support both end-users and building managers in identifying energy wastage and implementing effective strategies for sustainable building performance.

## Featured Cover Paper: Enhancing Human-Robot Collaboration in Healthcare 4.0.

Our paper was featured on the cover page, highlighting our contribution to safe and intuitive human-robot collaboration in Healthcare 4.0. We proposed a modular proximity sensing solution based on self-capacitive technology, enabling collaborative robots to detect approach and contact. Operating in both interaction and safety modes, the system supports gesture-based control and obstacle avoidance, enhancing telehealthcare delivery in human-centred environments.
