## User Acceptance of Ambient Assisted Living Technologies in the Home Environment

This explores the human factors in the adoption of ambient assisted living systems in the home environment.

Understanding User Perspectives on Ambient Assisted Living Technologies in the Home Environment.

Factors Influencing the Adoption of Ambient Assisted Living Technologies in the Home Environment.



Research in HCID covers a broad range of topics and design-oriented studies and interventions. Our work falls across three intersecting axes of research.

The study of individual and social issues arising from and surrounding the proliferation of information and communication technologies.
The development of design methods that enable us to engage with people and communities and explore new technological possibilities.
The prototyping of interactive systems that use existing and novel technologies in response to real-world needs.
