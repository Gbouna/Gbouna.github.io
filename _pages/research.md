## Human Activity Analysis in Home Environment

This research focuses on the development of novel deep learning models for analysing human activity in the home environment. The models are designed to address the challenges that influence user acceptance of activity monitoring in the home environment, as well as the unique challenges of deploying activity monitoring systems in the unstructured home environment. Some of the challenges include balancing the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency to enable accurate activity monitoring on low-cost resource-constrained embedded systems, privacy and data security in monitoring systems, and user agency and autonomy over monitoring systems.

## Computer Vision for Smart and Sustainable Home Environment Management

This research focuses on occupant-centred control of building systems to achieve the balance of a thermally comfortable home environment and energy consumption. The focus is on non-invasive and privacy-preserving approaches to capture user data, which is then used to train deep learning models to analyse the comfort level of the user, which is then used to automate the building systems such as HVAC.
