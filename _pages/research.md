## Human Activity Analysis in Home Environment

This research focuses on the development of novel deep learning models for analysing human activity in the home environment. The models are designed to address the challenges that influence user acceptance of activity monitoring in the home environment, as well as the unique challenges of deploying activity monitoring systems in the unstructured home environment. Some of the challenges include balancing the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency to enable accurate activity monitoring on low-cost resource-constrained embedded systems, privacy and data security in monitoring systems, and user agency and autonomy over monitoring systems.

## Computer Vision for Human-Centred Smart and Sustainable Building Management

This research focuses on occupant-centred control of building systems to achieve the balance of a thermally comfortable environment and energy consumption. The focus is on non-invasive and privacy-preserving approaches to capture user data, which is then used to train deep learning models to analyse the comfort level of the user, which is then used to automate the building systems such as HVAC.

## User Acceptance of Ambient Assisted Living Technologies in the Home Environment

This explores the human factors in the adoption of ambient assisted living systems in the home environment.

Understanding User Perspectives on Ambient Assisted Living Technologies in the Home Environment.

Factors Influencing the Adoption of Ambient Assisted Living Technologies in the Home Environment.



Research in HCID covers a broad range of topics and design-oriented studies and interventions. Our work falls across three intersecting axes of research.

The study of individual and social issues arising from and surrounding the proliferation of information and communication technologies.
The development of design methods that enable us to engage with people and communities and explore new technological possibilities.
The prototyping of interactive systems that use existing and novel technologies in response to real-world needs.
